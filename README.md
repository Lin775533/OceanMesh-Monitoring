- Solar-powered, waterproof ESP devices with positioning capabilities
- Communication ranges from 100-500 meters between ESPs
- Long-range communication (20-40+ km) to base stations
- Comprehensive data collection at base stations

## 2. Hardware Selection Analysis

### 2.1 ESP32 Platform Selection

  - Dual-core processor enables parallel processing of communication and sensors
  - Built-in WiFi/Bluetooth reduces component count
  - Deep sleep mode (10µA) extends battery life
  - Rich peripheral support (SPI, I2C, UART)
  - Cost-effective ($5-10 per unit)

- **Disadvantages**:
  - Limited RAM (520KB) requires careful memory management
  - Higher power consumption compared to simpler MCUs
  - WiFi range limitations require more nodes
  - Temperature sensitivity requires additional cooling

- **Alternative Considered**: Arduino Mega + Separate WiFi Module
  - Rejected due to higher complexity and power consumption
  - Would require additional components and increase failure points

  - Initial cost higher than non-rechargeable solutions
  - Battery replacement needed every 2-3 years

- **Alternative Considered**: Fuel Cell System
  - Rejected due to maintenance complexity and fuel logistics
  - Would provide longer runtime but at higher operational cost

## 3. Communication Protocol Implementation

### 3.1 Protocol Consideration and Selection Rationale

#### Protocols Considered

In developing our maritime communication system, we evaluated several protocols that could potentially meet our requirements. Traditional WiFi, while widely available, proved unsuitable due to its high power consumption and limited range in maritime environments. Cellular (4G/LTE) offered good coverage but came with significant drawbacks: high subscription costs, dependency on third-party infrastructure, and potential coverage gaps in remote maritime areas.

We also considered standalone LoRaWAN implementation. While it offers impressive range capabilities, its relatively high latency (around 100ms) would impact real-time vessel tracking. Additionally, pure LoRaWAN systems can become overwhelmed in scenarios with numerous nodes transmitting frequently, as would be the case in busy shipping lanes.

Bluetooth and ZigBee were also evaluated but quickly ruled out due to their limited range and susceptibility to interference in maritime environments. Satellite communication, while offering global coverage, proved prohibitively expensive and introduced unacceptable latency for real-time operations.

#### Selection of ESP-NOW and LoRaWAN Hybrid Approach

After careful analysis, we determined that no single protocol could adequately address all our requirements. This led us to develop a hybrid approach combining ESP-NOW for local communication and LoRaWAN for long-range base station connectivity. This combination leverages the strengths of each protocol while mitigating their individual weaknesses.

ESP-NOW was chosen for ship-to-ship communication due to its exceptional characteristics in local networking:
- Ultra-low latency of 2ms enables real-time position tracking
- Connectionless nature significantly reduces power consumption
- Built-in acknowledgment mechanism ensures reliable data delivery
- Mesh networking capability extends effective coverage area

LoRaWAN complements ESP-NOW by providing robust long-range communication:
- Exceptional range of up to 50km in maritime environments
- Superior penetration through waves and weather conditions
- Very low power consumption for long-distance transmission
- Licensed spectrum operation reduces interference

#### Advantages and Limitations

The hybrid approach offers several key advantages for maritime operations. The ESP-NOW component provides immediate, low-latency communication essential for collision avoidance and real-time positioning. Its mesh networking capability creates a self-healing network that maintains connectivity even if individual nodes fail.

LoRaWAN's long-range capabilities ensure reliable communication with shore-based stations, while its excellent penetration characteristics maintain connectivity even in adverse weather conditions. The protocol's adaptive data rate and spreading factor optimization help maximize range and reliability while minimizing power consumption.

However, this approach does have some limitations. The system requires more complex hardware at gateway nodes, which must handle both protocols. Additionally, there's a slight increase in power consumption at gateway nodes compared to single-protocol solutions.



### 3.2 Network Architecture
